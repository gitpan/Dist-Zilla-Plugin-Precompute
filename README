NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Precompute - Precompute variable values during
    building

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.01 of Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Precompute
    (from Perl distribution Dist-Zilla-Plugin-Precompute), released on
    2014-09-30.

SYNOPSIS
    In "dist.ini":

     [Precompute/foo]
     code=Some::Module->_init_value;

    in your module "lib/Some/Module.pm":

     our $foo; # PRECOMPUTE

    The generated module file:

     our $foo = ["some", "value", "..."]; # PRECOMPUTE

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin can be used to precompute (or initialize) a variable's value
    during build time and put the resulting computed value into the built
    source code. This is useful in some cases to reduce module startup time,
    especially if it takes some time to compute the value.
