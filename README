NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Precompute - Precompute variable values during
    building

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.03 of Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Precompute
    (from Perl distribution Dist-Zilla-Plugin-Precompute), released on
    2014-10-02.

SYNOPSIS
    In "dist.ini":

     [Precompute/FOO]
     code=Some::Module->_init_value;
     [Precompute / Some::Module::BAR]
     code=some Perl code

    in your module "lib/Some/Module.pm":

     package Some::Module;
     our $FOO; # PRECOMPUTE
     our $BAR; # PRECOMPUTE

    in your module "lib/Some/OtherModule.pm":

     package Some::OtherModule;
     our $FOO; # PRECOMPUTE
     our $BAR; # PRECOMPUTE

    In the generated "lib/Some/Module.pm":

     our $FOO = ["some", "value", "..."]; # PRECOMPUTE
     our $BAR = "some other value"; # PRECOMPUTE

    In the generated "lib/Some/OtherModule.pm" (the second precompute only
    matches $Some::Module::BAR and not $BAR from other package):

     our $FOO = ["some", "value", "..."]; # PRECOMPUTE
     our $BAR; # PRECOMPUTE

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin can be used to precompute (or initialize) a variable's value
    during build time and put the resulting computed value into the built
    source code. This is useful in some cases to reduce module startup time,
    especially if it takes some time to compute the value.
